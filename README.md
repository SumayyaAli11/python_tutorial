# Python Tutorial

Welcome to the Python Tutorial repository! This repository contains a collection of Python scripts that cover various fundamental topics in Python programming. 
Each script is designed to provide clear and concise examples to help you understand and master these essential concepts and data structures.

## Contents

- **Lists**: Learn about Python lists, their properties, and common operations you can perform with them.
- **Tuples**: Understand what tuples are, how they differ from lists, and when to use them.
- **Sets**: Explore sets, their unique characteristics, and how to use them for efficient data handling.
- **Dictionaries**: Get to know dictionaries, a powerful way to store and retrieve data using key-value pairs.
- **Conditional Statements**: Master if, elif, and else statements to control the flow of your programs.
- **For Loops**: Use for loops to iterate over sequences and perform repetitive tasks.
- **While Loops**: Implement while loops for repeated execution based on a condition.
- **Functions**: Define and use functions to organize and reuse your code effectively.
- **Lambda Functions**: Understand lambda functions for creating small, anonymous functions.
- **File Handling**: Learn to read from and write to files, and manage file operations.
